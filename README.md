# MatPlotLib-Challenge

1 - We can see from the barchart that Ramicane and Capomulin were the 2 drugs that were used most often in the test, having the highest of the regiment counts.

2 - Based on the mices gender, about 121 mice of the 248 mice were female while the rest are male. With further testing/data, we could identify if the drugs were more or less effective based on gender.

3 - From the boxplot, we can see that Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective out of the 4 regimens, having the lowest tumor volume per cubic millimeter.

4 - For mouse t565 using Capomulin, over the course of 45 days, the lowest point of its tumor volume as after day 30 of usage. After day 30, the tumor volume seemed to have grown a bit in the course of 15 days of use.

5 - It seems that the more the mouse weighs, a higher tumor volume can be expected.
